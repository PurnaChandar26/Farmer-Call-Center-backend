Farmer Call Center Backend
==========================

This repository contains the backend code for the Farmer Call Center application, an AI-based voice-assisted contact center designed to assist farmers with their problems. Farmers can log their problems through phone calls, SMS, or the website, and in return, an automated voice response provides the farmers with the most appropriate solutions for their problems.

Features
--------

-   Localization: The system supports localization, allowing farmers to interact in their preferred language.
-   NLP Algorithm: The application uses a Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithm and a knowledge base repository to provide the best solutions to farmers' problems.
-   Crop Recommendation: Farmers can receive recommendations on suitable crops based on their location, soil conditions, and other relevant factors.
-   Fertilizer Recommendation: The system provides personalized fertilizer recommendations based on crop type, soil analysis, and other factors.
-   Disease Prediction: Farmers can get predictions on potential diseases affecting their crops, along with preventive measures and treatment suggestions.
-   Weather Forecasting: The application provides real-time weather forecasting to help farmers make informed decisions about their agricultural activities.
-   AI Voice Assistance: An AI-powered voice assistant interacts with farmers, understands their queries, and provides appropriate responses using voice-based communication.
-   Voice SMS in Local Language: Farmers can receive voice-based SMS messages in their local language, ensuring effective communication.

Technology Stack
----------------

-   Backend: The backend is developed using Flask, a lightweight and flexible Python web framework.
-   Storage: AWS S3 Bucket is used for storing audio files and other media assets.
-   SMS Service: Twilio is integrated to handle SMS communication between the contact center and farmers.
-   IDE: VS Code is recommended as the integrated development environment for working with the backend code.
-   Design: Figma and Canva are used for designing and creating visual assets.
-   API Testing & Documentation: Postman is utilized for testing and documenting the backend APIs.
-   Version Control: Git and GitHub are used for version control and collaborative development.
