        The intended use of a triple 20 fertilizer is primarily to increase plant success and fertility in poor soil. But, it’s also effective for use on plants grown in hanging baskets to accommodate for the heavy leaching that occurs.  

When used appropriately, a 20-20-20 NPK encourages vibrant foliage to ensure optimum photosynthesis. While providing maximum support for flower and fruit formation.
